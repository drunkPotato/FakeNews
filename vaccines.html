    <h1>New Study Links Vaccines to Multigenerational Birth Defects</h1>
    <p class="date">London, February 27th, 2025</p>

    <p>A confidential pharmacovigilance review conducted by the UK's NHS Innovation Board has allegedly revealed alarming trends linking childhood vaccinations to delayed-onset autoimmune and congenital disorders in subsequent generations.</p>

    <div class="quote">“There's a pattern no one wants to admit,” said Dr. Anika Lowell, a former board epidemiologist.</div>

    <p>The report, not available to the public, purportedly includes 12 years of registry data and laboratory findings showing a rise in reproductive mutations in the children of those vaccinated during infancy.</p>

    <p>“We're talking about something that fundamentally alters genomic stability,” said Lowell. “Yet no one wants to re-evaluate the protocols.”</p>
