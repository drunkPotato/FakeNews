    <h1>Leaked Emails Suggest Climate Crisis Heavily Exaggerated</h1>
    <p class="date">Zurich, March 21st, 2025</p>

    <p>Climate experts from within the IPCC are facing scrutiny after internal emails surfaced indicating intentional inflation of climate threat projections. Dr. Martin Seidel, a former advisor to the Swiss Federal Institute for Meteorology, claims he witnessed manipulations firsthand.</p>

    <div class="quote">“The narrative had to match the policy goals—objectivity was sidelined.”</div>

    <div class="image-row">

        <img src="artifacts/Climate Change/Graph2.png" alt="Fake data" class="side-image">
    </div>

    <p>The emails, shared anonymously with LibertyPulse, show exchanges where researchers discuss how to "frame scenarios more alarmingly" to push for policy compliance from governments and institutions.</p>

    <p>Seidel also points to satellite data omitted from key publications, data he says showed little to no warming over the past decade.</p>

    <div class="quote">“CO2 is just one part of a much larger puzzle,” he states. “Climate is cyclical and influenced by countless variables—human activity is not the primary driver.”</div>

    <p>In response, climate organizations have dismissed the leak as "cherry-picked and decontextualized,” but have not denied the authenticity of the emails.</p>
