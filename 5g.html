    <h1>Massive Cover-Up: 5G’s Alarming Impact on Human Fertility</h1>
    <p class="date">Washington D.C., April 14th, 2025</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t believe what I was reading,” said Dr. Eleanor Vasquez, head of reproductive neuroendocrinology at the Harvard Center for Neuroreproductive Studies, after reviewing what she calls a "buried internal report" detailing severe fertility disruptions linked to prolonged 5G exposure.</p>
    <div class="quote">“For years, we dismissed these concerns as conspiracy theory,” she admitted. “But the data in that report... it’s alarming.”</div>
    <p>The report—marked "For Internal Review Only" and dated March 2022—was allegedly circulated among a select group of federal health advisors and never released through academic channels.</p>
    <p>It claims a 27% drop in viable sperm counts in male lab rodents after nine months of exposure to simulated 5G signals. Similar declines were reportedly observed in female ovarian development.</p>

    <p>Dr. Vasquez states that scientists were pressured to stay silent, some allegedly paid off to suppress their findings.</p>
    <div class="quote">“They were working under federal contracts—and they were told not to release anything that might interfere with the 5G rollout.”</div>
    <p>Senator Alan Dorsey (R-UT) has called for an emergency hearing and full disclosure of internal FCC communications.</p>
